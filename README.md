Product Registration Automation with Python

This project automates the product registration process using Python and PyAutoGUI. The script reads product data from an Excel spreadsheet and automatically fills out a web form to register each product.

The automation interacts with the registration page available at:

This project demonstrates practical skills in task automation, data handling with Excel, and browser interaction, simulating a real-world scenario where repetitive manual input is replaced by an efficient automated solution.
